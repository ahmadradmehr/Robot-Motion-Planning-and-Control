### A* Search
In this programming assignment, A* search is implemented. Given a graph, the start node, and the goal node, the program searches the graph for a minimum-cost path from the start to the goal. The program either returns a sequence of nodes for a minimum-cost path or indicates that no solution exists.  
The program successfully reads the nodes, edges, and obstacles data and coordinates from seperated .CSV files and finally writes the found minimum-cost-path to another .CSV file.
CoppeliaSim is used to visualize the graph and the solution path found by the program.
